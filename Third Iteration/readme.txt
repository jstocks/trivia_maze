- No known issues with the project.  Both the GUI and SQLite / database are coming along nicely.

The biggest hurdle this week was learning GUI and SQLite commands and coding, so it took longer than expected. We might be slightly behind as we develop both the Question Class / logic around answering questions, and the associated GUI integration.  We'll get there.
